# MQTT Topic Tree Visualiser


## Description

Uses a number of visualisation libraries to provide different views of an MQTT topic tree. 

Intended to be used for development and as a nice demo tool. 

Thanks go to a variety of guides and developers who helped along the way in understanding how to integrate these visualisation libraries with React.js

Major thanks to [Andy Stanford-Clark](https://github.com/andysc) for being the most sought-after user tester, and for contributing to the solution.

# MQTT Topic Tree Visualiser

ToDo:  

1) Check what happens when new messages arrive (avoid expensive re-render) / subscriptions don’t work yet - maybe that’s why I can’t connect to eclipse
2) which port does it assume for wss ? I tried wss://MQTT.eclipseprojects.io:443 (with topic tree ‘andysc/#’ ) and it says offline then reconnecting
3) Nodes laid out horizontally
4) Add meta, git, testing instructions

# MQTT Topic Tree Visualiser

ToDo:  

1) Check what happens when new messages arrive (avoid expensive re-render)
2) Styling - tailwind? 
3) deploy
5) which port does it assume for wss ? I tried wss://MQTT.eclipseprojects.io:443 (with topic tree ‘andysc/#’ ) and it says offline then reconnecting
7) needs to lay the topics out closer together they’re very far apart
8) subscriptions don’t work yet - maybe that’s why I can’t connect to eclipse
